+ model based approach
+ concerns pictorial synthesis of real or imagery objects from computer based model
+ deals with vector data

## Overview of Rendering Pipeline
1. Input: 3D Primitives
2. Modeling Transformation: Transform into 3D world coordinate system
3. Lighting: Illuminate according to lighting and reflection
4. Viewing Transformation: Transform into 3D camera coordinate system
5. Projection Transformation: Transform into 2D camera coordinate system
6. Clipping: Clipping the basic shape out of the camera point of view
7. Viewport Transformation: Transform into image coordinate system
8. Scan Conversion: Pixel Drawing (includes texturing, hidden surface etc)
9. Output: Image

## Final Project
### Rendering virtual space with SOR Modeling Data and Navigation<br>
Develop a program that stores various objects created using the SOR modeler and uses it to organize virtual spaces and change perspectives and rendering styles.
